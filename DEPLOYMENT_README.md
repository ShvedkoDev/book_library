## ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT: Hostinger Hosting Limitation

**Hostinger has confirmed:** Docker requires root access, which is **NOT available** on Hostinger's shared Web or Cloud hosting plans. Docker can only run on VPS plans.

**Your current hosting:** Cloud/Shared hosting for domain `micronesian.school`

- **Cons:**
  - Requires manual configuration
  - No containerization benefits

**ðŸ‘‰ Follow:** [DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md](./DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md) (Quick guide)

### Option 2: Upgrade to VPS + Docker

Upgrade your Hostinger plan to VPS to get root access and use Docker.

- **Pros:**
  - Full Docker support
  - Root server access
  - Automated deployment via Docker Compose

- **Cons:**
  - Additional cost (~$5-10/month for VPS)
