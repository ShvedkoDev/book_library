# TODO: Library Pages Implementation

## 📊 Implementation Status (Updated: 2025-10-23)

**Overall Progress: ~85% Complete** 🎉

### ✅ Completed
- **Phase 1**: Setup & Architecture (Routes, Controllers, Layouts) - 100% ✅
- **Phase 2**: Library Listing Page (Search, Filters, Pagination, Sorting) - 95% ✅
- **Phase 3**: Book Detail Page (Full metadata display, Related books) - 90% ✅
- SEO & Meta tags (basic implementation)
- Responsive design
- Eager loading to prevent N+1 queries

### ⚠️ Partially Implemented
- File viewing/downloading routes (UI buttons exist, backend routes not implemented)

- User favorites/sharing (UI buttons exist, no backend functionality)

### ❌ Not Started
- Phase 4: Advanced features (thumbnails generation, caching, analytics)
- Phase 5: Testing & QA
- Phase 6: Deployment tasks
- Laravel Scout integration
- Schema.org structured data

---

## Overview
Implement public-facing library pages for browsing and viewing books based on the HTML design templates in `public/ui-test/final/`:
- **Library Listing Page** (`library.html`) - Browse all books with search and filters
- **Book Detail Page** (`book.html`) - Individual book pages with metadata and files

## Prerequisites
- ✅ Database schema complete with books, files, classifications, languages, etc.
- ✅ Filament admin panel functional for managing books
- ✅ UI templates available in `public/ui-test/final/`

---

## Phase 1: Setup & Architecture

### 1.1 Create Routes
**File:** `routes/web.php`

- [x] Create library index route: `GET /library`
- [x] Create book detail route: `GET /library/book/{slug}` or `GET /library/book/{id}`
- [x] Consider SEO-friendly slugs for books (auto-generated from title)

### 1.2 Create Controllers
**Files:** `app/Http/Controllers/`

- [x] Create `LibraryController.php`
  - `index()` - List all books with filters/search
  - `show($slug)` - Display single book detail
- [x] Add proper dependency injection for models
- [x] Implement authorization checks (if needed for different access levels)

### 1.3 Create Livewire Components (Recommended Approach)
**Files:** `app/Livewire/`

- [ ] ~~Create `Library/BookList.php` component for the listing page~~ (SKIPPED - Used traditional Blade approach instead)
  - ~~Handle real-time search~~
  - ~~Handle filter interactions~~
  - ~~Handle pagination~~
  - ~~Handle sorting~~
- [ ] ~~Create `Library/BookDetail.php` component for book page~~ (SKIPPED - Used traditional Blade approach instead)
- [ ] ~~Create `Library/BookFilters.php` sub-component for the sidebar filters~~ (SKIPPED)
- [ ] ~~Create `Library/SearchBar.php` sub-component~~ (SKIPPED)

**OR** use traditional Blade templates if no real-time interactivity needed. ✅ **USED TRADITIONAL BLADE APPROACH**

---

## Phase 2: Library Listing Page (`/library`)

### 2.1 Backend - Controller Logic
**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/LibraryController.php` or `app/Livewire/Library/BookList.php`

- [x] Query all active books (`is_active = true`)
- [x] Implement keyword search across:
  - Book title
  - Book description
  - Creator names
  - ~~Keywords~~ (not implemented yet)
  - Publisher name
  - Collection name
- [x] Implement filter logic:
  - **Subject** (from classification types - Purpose/Genre)
  - **Grade Level** (from learner level classifications)
  - **Resource Type** (from type classifications or physical_type)
  - **Language** (from languages relationship)
  - **Publication Year** (from publication_year)
- [x] Implement sorting options:
  - ~~Relevance (default with search)~~ (not implemented)
  - Title A-Z
  - ~~Author/Creator~~ (not implemented)
  - Date Added (created_at)
  - Most Popular (view_count)
- [x] Implement pagination (10, 20, 50, 100 items per page)
- [x] Eager load relationships to avoid N+1 queries:
  ```php
  Book::with(['languages', 'creators', 'publisher', 'collection', 'files'])
  ```

### 2.2 Frontend - Blade View
**File:** `resources/views/library/index.blade.php`

- [x] Copy HTML structure from `public/ui-test/final/library.html`
- [x] Create master layout if not exists: `resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php`
  - Include header with logos and navigation
  - Include Guide/Library toggle
  - Include language selector (placeholder)
  - Include footer
- [x] Replace static HTML with dynamic Blade/Livewire:
  - [x] Results count display
  - [x] Book table/grid with data from database
  - [x] Thumbnail images (from book files where `file_type = 'thumbnail'`)
  - [x] Book title (linked to detail page)
  - [x] Metadata display (date, publisher)
  - [x] Description (from genres, languages, access level)
  - [x] Action buttons (Locate/View button)
- [x] Implement search input with Livewire `wire:model.live` or Alpine.js
- [x] Implement filter checkboxes with auto-filter on change
- [x] Implement entries per page dropdown
- [x] Implement pagination controls
- [x] Implement sort dropdown

### 2.3 Search & Filter Logic
**Implementation in Livewire or Controller**

- [x] Keyword search implementation:
  ```php
  $query->where(function($q) use ($search) {
      $q->where('title', 'like', "%{$search}%")
        ->orWhere('description', 'like', "%{$search}%")
        ->orWhereHas('creators', fn($q) => $q->where('name', 'like', "%{$search}%"))
        ->orWhereHas('publisher', fn($q) => $q->where('name', 'like', "%{$search}%"));
  });
  ```
- [x] Filter by classifications (AND logic for multiple filters):
  ```php
  if (!empty($filters['subject'])) {
      $query->whereHas('purposeClassifications', fn($q) =>
          $q->whereIn('slug', $filters['subject'])
      );
  }
  ```
- [x] Filter by languages:
  ```php
  if (!empty($filters['languages'])) {
      $query->whereHas('languages', fn($q) =>
          $q->whereIn('slug', $filters['languages'])
      );
  }
  ```
- [x] Clear filters functionality
- [x] Toggle filter groups (collapsed/expanded)

### 2.4 Styling & Assets
**Files:** `resources/css/` and `public/ui-test/final/assets/`

- [ ] Copy CSS from `public/ui-test/final/assets/css/` to Laravel assets
- [ ] Integrate with Laravel Mix/Vite:

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Recommended Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Laravel 12.x controllers or Livewire 3.x components
- **Frontend:** Blade templates with Alpine.js for interactivity
- **Search:** Laravel Scout (optional, for advanced search) or Eloquent where clauses
- **Pagination:** Laravel's built-in pagination
- **File Serving:** Laravel storage with symlink or CDN
- **Caching:** Redis or File cache for filter options and popular queries

### Database Queries - Best Practices

```php
// Example efficient query for library listing
$books = Book::query()
    ->select(['id', 'title', 'description', 'publication_year', 'access_level', 'created_at'])
    ->with([
        'languages:id,name,slug',
        'creators:id,name',
        'publisher:id,name',
        'files' => fn($q) => $q->where('file_type', 'thumbnail')->where('is_primary', true),
    ])
    ->where('is_active', true)
    ->when($search, function($q) use ($search) {
        // Search logic
    })
    ->when($filters, function($q) use ($filters) {
        // Filter logic
    })
    ->orderBy($sortColumn, $sortDirection)
    ->paginate($perPage);
```
