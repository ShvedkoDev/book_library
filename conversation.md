Hi Danko! I'm really happy to be into your shorlist and hope we can work together in a good and productive way in order to reach your deadline and build an amazing product!
Regarding your question about the PDF file downloading - i can say yes, we can build a page in between the library page and the PDf file itself in order to manipulate with the given information like username, date and etc.
Let me know if you have further questions.
Best,
Hennadii

Hennadii, thanks. Let's work together on this 🙂
I think we might have a bit of a problem with time zones, as I am GMT+10, but hopefully we'll get the hang of it as we go. I am going to send you the job offer now. If you accept, I will set up the first milestone as discussed. At your end, when you accept, please let me know the most urgent information you need from me to get started.

Danko Taborosi sent an offer

We are seeking an expert full-stack developer to create a website with both static and dynamic components. The website will feature a 1) resource guide (static part, a set of resource guide pages -- informational, based on a template and Word document) and a 2) resource library (dynamic part, a searchable/browsable resource library with ~2,500 PDFs, using metadata from an Excel spreadsheet). Though the content of the library is relatively small in terms of items, it must be set up for each maintenance, capable of adding items, and with most functionality of https://openlibrary.org/.



We are an NGO working in Micronesia. School teachers in our part of the world struggle with finding educational materials in the different languages spoken in our islands. We have created a large collection of scanned books and metadata, and wish to serve them to the teachers via a professional, comprehensive, and easy to use website.



The details of what the site should look like and its functionality are shown in the attached LIBRARY-PLAN.pdf.
Please review this carefully before applying. This is a straightforward task in the sense that we have defined it well and there are live examples elsewhere for all we need, but it is not easy as we need the developer to contribute ideas, advice, and solutions; pay attention equally to design and functionality; and be able to create a beautiful and useful website and checking and improving their own work without being micromanaged.



Please understand that this is far more than a simple website – it’s a content management and delivery platform, though not as complex as a full custom app. The work includes importing/cleaning metadata from Excel into a proper database; building a system for users to search, filter, and view PDFs based on metadata; implementing PDF storage and delivery (on the server and web address we have); designing and coding the front-end interface for browsing/searching; setting up the back-end protocols to query the database and serve metadata and PDFs, etc. That said, the LIBRARY-PLAN.pdf is pretty definitive so there should be no surprises, but you must understand that we can't predict everything before starting so you must show adaptability and flexibility.



Our deadline is strict (November 30, 2025) and our budget is fixed ($3,000) as our the milestones:
1) 10% payable after the first complete draft with basic functionality of the library (using 10 books as examples)
2) 10% payable after final draft with final design and full functionality of the library
3) 10% payable with full functionality of added functions of regular users and admin users
4) 70% payable on final delivery



Looking forward to working with you!

Est. Budget: $3,000.00

Milestone 1: first complete draft of the website, with only basic functionality with 10 books in the library part

Due: Sunday, Sep 21, 2025

That's great, Hennadii. Looking forward to working with you on this.

Take your time today going over the document I sent, explaining how we imagine the website. Of course, feel free to contribute your ideas on anything, from design to functionality. I should let you know that the material for the first, static, part of the website is now available in draft form. It's quite enough to start working on it as long as we can update the text later when it's all finalized at our end. The draft for the static part of the website is here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lZncySMpuCgMgwlrKJvhvVJ3HzVVOHgj5Dt_bCQuwpg/edit?tab=t.0 (it's a bit hard for you to deal with it in this draft form, so we'll try to turn it into a nicely designed and better organized PDF soon; that might be easier to "translate" to static pages).

Hi Danko!



I investigated yesterday one more time the project and have the follwoing questions:
1 - do you have a preferences for infrastructure like hosting (Amazon webservices, Google cloud, any other particulat hosting provider and etc.)?
2 - how big your budget for infrastructure?
3 - Do you want to have a continuous integration and continuous development system for your project integrated into Github or Gitlab?
4 - Further you can find my draft of the web pages design (mockups). There are variants of the design: Bootstrap academical, Tailwind modern and Google Material design. Also on the right top position near the login button is an icon where you can switch the colour schemes of the templates. Please check them and deside which one would you like to use as the template for the project. Based on this template I'll start building the UI kit (the page with all possible HTML elements styled with this design) to have a possibility to follow the design standards. After UI kit I can start buiding Database structure and the login/registration and Admin dashboard.
Of cource your suggestions and wishes to mockups are welcome. Here are the links to the test pages:
https://shvedko.dev/test/ui-test/academic/
https://shvedko.dev/test/ui-test/material/
https://shvedko.dev/test/ui-test/modern/
All these 3 mockups are the quickest design solutions based on the UI and UX bestpractices.



Looking forward hearing from you any feedback!
Best,
Hennadii

BTW: in all 3 mockups there 3 pages: guides, library and login, please feel free to click on the button on those pages to see the functionality

Hello Hennadii,
Thanks for the questions and the mockups. Let me follow the same order of your message and repsond.

1 - do you have a preferences for infrastructure like hosting (Amazon webservices, Google cloud, any other particulat hosting provider and etc.)?



We have a hosting account on Hostinger and the domain micronesian.school
At some point, I will give you access so that you can start building there.



2 - how big your budget for infrastructure?



There is no budget for infrastructure. We already have hosting and domain.



3 - Do you want to have a continuous integration and continuous development system for your project integrated into Github or Gitlab?



Yes, it should be integrated into our Github account.

Regarding the mockups... I am surprised at how quickly you created them, that's very positive. But at the same time, I was a bit taken aback by these templates because I gave very clear visual instructions regarding the look, design, colors. So, to answer your question, I would like the look to be like I requested in the job post, and not like any of these three templates.



However, I understand your point regarding customizing the UI kit and perhaps can look into the templates again to see how we can adjust different parameters to make the overall look closer to what our original request is. But before doing that, I would like to ask is there a reason you selected these templates so different from the design I requested? I even gave you the website from which you can copy code etc. to customize for ours. This website is by a partner entity and we're allowed to copy design elements from it.

Hennadii Shvedko
12:08 PM
Ah, I see your point! Sorry for missunderstanding about the templates. I didn't get the point, that i have to make a kind of "copy" of the given page. I'll work one more time on the template and will send you the result soon.
Just to avoid another confusion: the partner website is the https://coe.hawaii.edu/stems2/ulu-education-toolkit-guide/ correct?

DT
Danko Taborosi
12:19 PM
Yes, that is the correct website. If it is not too much trouble, copy that design and later we will change some elements (colors, logos, divider graphics, etc.) to customize. Now, I should say that I am amazed at how quickly you made the templates and especially that the templates already have some basic functionality. It's fantastic job and it tells me I hired the right person.



Now, regarding the design, it my request OK? Can you adapt your templates to more or less follow the design I gave you? Like you, I want to make sure that no time is wasted at either end due to miscommunication. I am sure that we can make a fantastic product together.

Hennadii Shvedko
12:28 PM
Sure, it's not a problem to create a copy of given website. No worries I'll send you today another template done based on that website. We are not going to waste a time, that's not my style 😉

DT
Danko Taborosi
12:45 PM
Perfect, thank you. Just don't spend too much time on tuning any design details as even though we're copying the website design overall, we will adjust colors, graphics, some items later...

Hennadii Shvedko
1:08 PM
That's why i'd like to develop th UI kit to give you a possibility to see all elements we are using and then I will develope based on the UI kit a set of web-componenets which will be re-used everywhere in the app and can be adjusted any time wihtout expense

DT
Danko Taborosi
1:31 PM
Perfect. Sounds great!

Hennadii Shvedko

Hi Danko!
Here are new mockups of the 4 pages
https://shvedko.dev/test/ui-test/index.html
https://shvedko.dev/test/ui-test/library.html
https://shvedko.dev/test/ui-test/login.html
https://shvedko.dev/test/ui-test/book.html



Please notice that all images and logos i replaced for now with the random images (mock images) to do not have empty spaces on the pages. these random imgaes are always different after each page refresh, so do not wonder why before refresh the image was another.
Also on the book.html i made not 100% as you drafted - i put all book metadata into the tabs-view instead of showing them on the page at the same time (please check my screenshot). In my opinion displaing all metadata at the same time makes the page too long and not readable the content. But it's just a suggestion, if you won't agree with it I'll make in the way you draw in PDF.



Please let me know it these mockups are what you asked for.



Looking forward for your feedback.

Hennadii, thanks so much, this is a fantastic start!
I am going to review it in detail and get back to you. All understood about mock images/content and your recommendations with the tabs. I think it's a good idea, but I'll still confirm. Today is a bit difficult but I will do my best to get back to you tomorrow. In the next few days, as soon as have the design more or less pinned down, I would hope we can upload spreadsheet data and PDFs for 10 actual books to begin tuning to our own information.
Thanks again for the amazing progress in such a short time.

Dear Hennadii,
The mockups look really great. I will now comment on different items as I go down your message and the pages themselves:



1. The top bar, where we have "Educational institution 1" and "Educational institution 2" should look a bit like the top bar on this page: https://islands.fm/ You can keep the background color green, and put the "Government of the Federated States of Micronesia" logo from our sample on the left hand side. On the right hand side, there will be no logo, but the language selector.



1a. The language selector should be moved from the Menu bar to the top right of the top bar. The language "Marshallese" should be deleted, and these ones added: Ulithian, Woleaian, Satawalese, Mortlockese, Nukuoro, Kapingamarangi, Pingelapese, Mwoakilloaese. They should be put in alphabetical order as listed below. They should not be a typical menu item like the rest, but be visually separate, perhaps like in the attached "language-selector.png". The abbreviations are displayed instead of the full language name. We'll follow are 3-letter ISO codes are as follows:



chk Chuukese
eng English
kpg Kapingamarangi
kos Kosraean
mrl Mortlockese
mwv Mwoakilloaese
nkr Nukuoro
pif Pingelapese
pon Pohnpeian
stw Satawalese
uli Ulithian
woe Woleaian
yap Yapese



All language options other than English will be disabled, as we will not do mutli-language versions as part of this contract.



2. Menu bar, the switch between Resource Guide and Resource Library should look more like a switch, for example like in the attached "switch.png"



3. The wide yellow bar, on these two pages: https://shvedko.dev/test/ui-test/index.html and https://shvedko.dev/test/ui-test/library.html should have the attached logos instead of the current placeholders. These logos are in the attached "logos.zip". They should be placed in the order as follows: 1. NDOE, 2. iREi, 3. C4GTS



4. The little floating tab on the side is a good idea, but let's delete it for now (see attached "delete.png")



5. On the Library page (https://shvedko.dev/test/ui-test/library.html), the FILTER RESULTS section looks very nice. You can keep the current options (subject, grade level, etc.) just please do the following: a) make each group collapsable and fully collapsed at the start; b) add a space between each checkbox and its text; 3) make the filtering automatically applied the instant the user clicks a checkbox; as user proceeds to check more boxes, the content gets automatically filtered each time, without clicking the "Apply Filters" button; 4) if the previous step is done correctly, "Apply Filters" button will not be needed and can be deleted; 5) "Clear All" button can be removed and its function transferred to an icon on the right hand side of the "FILTER RESULTS" heading, in the same way you have the magnifying glass icon to the right of the "SEARCH LIBRARY" heading. Finally, the "SEARCH LIBRARY" should be renamed "KEYWORD SEARCH".



6. On that same page, the height of the "SEARCH LIBRARY" ("KEYWORD SEARCH") box should be the same as the height of the "NUMBER OF ENTRIES" box.



7. One question we need to answer together is what will books will be displayed the first time this page is loaded. To me it would make sense to show ALL resources, beginning with 10 per page, but in that case, all "FILTER RESULTS" checkboxes would need to be checked by default, which is weird. It would be a hassle for the user to uncheck, and if they clear filters (uncheck all), then all results will disappear and the page would be empty. It's a kind of problem. What is the solution you would recommend? The only thing that comes to my mind is that the first time the page is loaded, all resources are displayed, but the checkboxes are manually made to look unchecked. However, the very first time a user checks any box, the filters get applied. And when they click "clear all" then it's equivalent to loading the page again.



8. As for the login page, we need to consider how we're distinguishing admin users and regular users. Admin users can presumably make edits, add new content etc. Regular users can do things like star ratings, review, add personal notes, etc.



9. I will provide feedback for the "https://shvedko.dev/test/ui-test/book.html" page separately a bit later today. I tend to agree with your appraisal that my original plan was making the page too busy.



Thanks so much. This is a fantastic start!

10. Please rename “Educational Resources” to “Available resources” (second word starts in lowercase). Also, please rename “Showing X books and resources” to “Showing X books and other resources”. Finally, could you please slightly change the alignment and design as in attached “Available resources.png"?

Hello Danko!



Sorry for delay, i've just finished working on your feedback. You can find the updated versions on the same URLs https://shvedko.dev/test/ui-test/library.html, https://shvedko.dev/test/ui-test/index.html. Here some notices:
1 - keep in mind to clear cach of the browse for these pages or make hard refresh (on Windows it's Ctrl+F5, on Mac I do not know the shortcut, sorry) in order to see all stlyling and javascript changes
2 - regarding the login: it's not a problem, we will work with RBAC (Role-Based Access Control). That means we will have 2 roles (or even more depends on the concept) admin and user. Admin will have access everywhere (admin dashboard, library, static pages). User must register (or been registered by admin) to have access to library but they will never have access to the admin dashboard (probably some profile page but not more). Static pages will be accessible always without login.
3 - regarding filters. I totally agree with what you suggested. First show all check boxes un-selected but all resources shown, then user can decide whethere they will adjust filtering and upon selecting the first filter checkbox we can filter the resources (probably start the filtering proccess with some delay after 1 or 2 seconds)
4 - please keep in mind that for now on the static pages the filtering is not working as this is just a mockup



Looking forward for your feedback and ready to start working on the feedback to the book page!
Best,
Hennadii

Hennadii, thanks so much. I apologize, but there will be a delay at my end. I am currently on a ship for work until October 4th. I expected to be able to use the internet and communicate normally while aboard, but it turns out that I can barely send messages and cannot load most websites. I tried to see the site today, but I couldn't load the whole thing, it looked messed up due to my low internet speed. I will try to access the website tomorrow. In the worst case, I might have to wait until October 4th to continue. I will try to release the payment now for the first milestone, as you have completed even more than I had hoped by this stage.

Hello Danko! It's not a problem at all. Take you time and when you will have ability to check just send me feedback. As far as I understood from your feedback I can start with the UI kit as we have almost all HTML elements on those 2 pages (your feedback was about some small adjustments and nothing crucial was changed myself). And when you will share feedback about the book page I'll adjust or extend the UI kit with corresponding elements. Also i can start working on the admin basic functionality like book management, categorsies mamangement, authors managements and other relevant to the library interfaces with the UI kit elements.
FYI: te payment came through, thank you!

Hennadii, thanks so much for your patience. I have checked the design of both pages and I think that we have a very good working draft now. I have nothing to change at this point, except the small issue with the names of languages in the language selector box being cut off (see attached picture).

1 - languages are truncated.png
1 - languages are truncated.png
Now, with this stage finished, it sounds like the ball is in my court. I am sorry for the delay, I honestly didn't know I would have no internet on the ship (we had different information previously) and I thought I'd get a lot of work done. Now I'm really behind and will try to catch up in the next 10 days. In general, I think that the key first stage of the work at your end is finished and what I need to do now is 1) send you the Resource Guide document so that you can turn it into a webpage, and, more importantly, 2) send you about 20-30 actual books with PDFs and all the info so that you can get all the data and metdata categories sorted out and working. That's what I will do next. I will try to send you this in the next few days. I prefer to have everything functioning perfectly with 20-30 items before uploading the whole collection. Also, I think it would be good to work with a test group first so that you can tell me if anything is wrong with our data/metadata categories and if we can make some improvements at our end before sending to you.

Here is one more super minor design suggestion, on the book page, for the "Number of entries" selector, you could also use a blue area like you have in the "Keyword search" box above (please see attached picture).

These are NOT for the current project, but for something else small that we can do next week on the side, as a separate project or a small extra milestone on the current project. I'll tell you about it next time, but for now could you please just download and keep? (The links will expire in a few days and it takes a long time to upload, so I'd prefer if you just get this now and we can talk about it later). Thanks!

Hennadii, thanks so much for your patience. We just drove 3650 km across the Australian desert, I am finally back "in civilization" where I have regular internet. On Tuesday night I get home and resume normal work.

I am happy to see that the two websites I sent you as a side project work on your local machine.

This is NOT related to our big project, but perhaps I can ask you to put them up online and get it out of the way? I'm happy to pay for it separately.

I have a server and domain ready. It is the same server (hostinger.com) and a different domain from what we are using for our main project.

Hostinger - Bring Your Idea Online With a Website
Choose Hostinger and make the perfect site. From Shared Hosting and Domains to VPS and Cloud plans. We have all you need for online success.
Hostinger
Our main project will go to micronesian.school whereas this side project (two little websites you downloaded) will go to hydroguam.net. Both of these domains are on Hostinger. What kind of information do you need from me so that you can access this?

Hi Danko! Wow! What a exciting live you have!!! Australian desert sounds great!

Regarding the projects you sent me (Southern and Nothern Guam) I think for me would be enough having an FTP access to the hosting server, so that i could upload the project to the hosting server.

It will take a lot of time as the projects are big but they should work immediatly, if we will encounter any other problem with hosting then probably i would need a full access to the hosting account as admin user

DT
Danko Taborosi
10:44 PM
Dear Hennadii, thank you. Could you please give me your email address so that I can grant you access to the hosting account for those two domains?

For the first one, hydroguam.net, all we'll need is to upload the two websites, plus the landing page attached here. Hopefully it will be easy, and you can let me know a reasonable amount to pay for that service, separately from our main work.



The main work will go to another domain, micronesian.school once ready to launch. I will give you access to both domains now.

Hi Danko! As i can see on Hostinger you hve only domains and no webhosting booked? Is it correct? If yes, we need to buy a hosting plan for the hydroguam.net. The both websites unpacked are about 15Gb that's why i would recommend to by Premium Web Hosting. after you will by it I'll be able to upload the websites

Hi Danko! The websites have been uploaded and you can find them live! One thing is missig - the icon showing external links (see my screenshot) which should be in the folder /sites/aciar/modules/extlink/extlink.png. Could you check this icon one more time and send me, I'll upload it live.

Thanks Hennadii, this is perfect! Let's please just do two things, I hope it's easy:



1) In the code just delete the little external icons, they are not necessary (the ones shown as broken links in your screenshot).. By deleting the icons from the code, we'll solve the problem of broken links. However, I did find some more important files whose links are broken and we'll fix that in steps 2 and 3 below.



2) Please download this archive from here https://www.transfernow.net/dl/20251013Z8Rbrdgj and upload its contents to https://hydroguam.net/maps-gis-all/ (do not unpack individual zip files inside the archive, they need to stay zipped, as these are files downloaded from the website as individual zipped packages).



3) Previously, we've had these files sitting in http://north.hydroguam.net/maps-gis-all and http://south.hydroguam.net/maps-gis-all but I realized that they are just copies of each other and were unnecessarily taking up space. So I prefer that both north and south rely on the same folder http://hydroguam.net/maps-gis-all/ which serves both subdomains. For that to work, we need to just change the links in each and every original html/php file where these links are mentioned. I hope you have a way to "search and replace" multiple files en masse in ALL files and make the following change:



http://north.hydroguam.net/maps-gis-all/ --> http://hydroguam.net/maps-gis-all/
http://south.hydroguam.net/maps-gis-all/ --> http://hydroguam.net/maps-gis-all/



If that's done, it should all work fine.



(This is an example of how the links will change:
http://south.hydroguam.net/maps-gis-all/hydrology-drainage-streamflow.zip
to this
http://hydroguam.net/maps-gis-all/hydrology-drainage-streamflow.zip
etc.)

Everything is great! I just noticed that you have not received some messages I sent by replying directly to an email forwarded to me by Upwork. It doesn't matter, from now on I will enter Upwork directly and write to you here. Basically, all I said is that the hydroguam website is perfect now, thank you. I also said that I began working on our main project again because I am finally home and able to focus on it 100%. I will now send you a sample with database of 10 items to get started.

Danko Taborosi

Here are the test files.
Test.ods shows the "database" spreadsheet.
categories explanations.ods explains the connections between spreadsheet categories and webpage contents.
The zip file contains test PDFs and cover page PNGs.



Please note that while the landing page design is pretty much done, the individual book pages still need a lot of work in terms of design. My intention is to provide detailed feedback on that as soon as you apply one or more of these sample books.



Hope this is clear more or less. I am now available to work on this full time until we finish, so there will be no more delays from my end (other than time zone issues -- I am in GMT+10).

Let me know any thoughts, comments, questions you may have. I hope that we're on the right track with the database spreadsheet format. We need to have a robust system that makes it easy to make changes on items that are on the website and to add new items in the future.

Hi Hennadii, thanks. Just please note that nothing is set in stone. I can adjust the spreadsheet in ways that are most convenient for you. We can decide together what works the best. Perhaps get started with the a basic book-page, then we can finalize the design for that page, then we can finalize the relationship between spreadsheet fields and specific bits of website content. With some luck, we can finish this in the coming week, and the week after I can send you the full book collection. It's just important to keep in mind that we need to be able to make edits relatively easily, in bulk if needed, and also to be easily able to add new books in the future. Our project will formally end next month or so when we upload everything, but we want to make sure that maintenance and updating is easy in the future.

Hi Danko! Please check my suggestion for the DB structure based on your categories explanations.ods:



Total Tables: 24
1 - Core Entities (8)
- users
- languages
- publishers
- collections
- creators
- classification_types
- classification_values
- geographic_locations
  2 - Books & Content (2)
- books
- book_keywords
  3 - Book Relationships (5)
- book_creators (authors, illustrators, editors)
- book_languages (supports bilingual books)
- book_classifications (Purpose, Genre, Type, etc.)
- book_locations (Island, State)
- book_relationships (4 types: same_version, same_language, supporting, other_language)
  4 - Files & References (2)
- book_files (PDFs, thumbnails, audio, video)
- library_references (UH, COM physical copies)
  5 - User Engagement (7)
- book_ratings
- book_reviews
- book_bookmarks
- book_views
- book_downloads
- terms_of_use_versions
- user_terms_acceptance



This outlines a normalized, search-optimized database design that:



✅ Captures all 64 metadata fields from the categories explanations.ods
✅ Enables efficient filtering with AND logic across multiple dimensions
✅ Supports multilingual books (2 languages per book)
✅ Handles complex creator relationships (authors, illustrators, editors with custom roles)
✅ Manages multiple file versions (primary + alternative PDFs, thumbnails, audio, video)
✅ Tracks 4 types of book relationships (same version, same language, supporting materials, different language)
✅ Maintains search performance with proper indexing



What do you think about this? I would prefer to use this DB structure as it follows best practices in DB design.
For all DB table there will be a separate interface for Admins. The relation tables will be also displayed in the Admin interface

Also if you agree with the DB structure then i need access to the hosting where will be live application hosted in order to show you what i have done. I need the real server as all this logic is based already on the PHP and MySQL DB

Hennadii, hi. In general, I have no problems adjusting the table to match the organization and naming you proposed so that it is all straightforward and optimized. Would you like to take the sample file I sent you and re-arrange and rename all the columns as you propose? Then you could save it and send it back to me, and I would adjust the full database at our end to follow this new format. Is that OK?

Regarding hosting, you already have access from when you fixed hydroguam.net for me. This new website will be on the same server, same Hostinger account. The domain is ready, you will find it in there, it is micronesian.school

Please let me know if you need anything else, or if I misunderstood something.

Hennadii Shvedko
9:04 PM
Hi Danko! Everything is clear regarding the webhosting. I'll work in existing micronesian.school one.
Please also find my suggestion with DB structure to your DB mapping in you test.ods file attached. I added a new row under your column names in teh following format "table_name"."filed_name" (e.g. books.internal_id will correspond to the DB table books column internal_id)

Hennadii, thank you. I have opened your new spreadsheet and will work to fill it in with our current huge database. Since there are many books, there perhaps might be some exceptions that would prompt me to do one or more of the following things:



1) Switch order of some columns
2) Add a new column
3) Some other minor adjustment



Is that OK to do, as long as I keep intact the entries you put in line 2?



Since this will take me a while to complete, would you be able to share with me a sample book webpage so that we can work on that page design at your end while I'm dealing with the full database at my end?

Hennadii Shvedko
