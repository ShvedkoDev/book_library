**Subject:** Digital Library Update: Cover Page Feature for PDFs

---

Dear [Customer Name],

I wanted to update you on the automatic cover page feature for your digital library PDFs.

## Current Situation

We've analyzed your 1,500 PDF files and found that:
- ✅ **50% work perfectly** – These can automatically get cover pages with book information
- ⚠️ **50% need attention** – These use a newer PDF format that our system cannot process

The good news is that all PDFs still download and display normally for users. The cover pages are just an enhancement that adds book details (title, author, publisher, etc.) as a first page.

## Three Options Available

### Option 1: Convert the PDFs (One-time fix)
**What it means:** We modify the 750 affected PDF files to work with the automatic cover page system.

**Pros:**
- One-time fix that works forever
- Free solution
- Small file size increase (~6%)

**Cons:**
- Requires downloading, converting, and re-uploading ~750 files
- Estimated 2-4 hours of work
- Future uploads may need the same process

**Cost:** Free (I provide the conversion tools)

---

### Option 2: Purchase Software License
**What it means:** We buy specialized software (€150-200) that handles all PDF formats automatically.

**Pros:**
- No manual work needed
- Works automatically with future uploads
- One-time purchase, permanent solution

**Cons:**
- Upfront cost of ~€150-200

**Cost:** €150-200 (one-time payment)

---

### Option 3: Keep Current System
**What it means:** Leave everything as is.

**Pros:**
- No cost, no work needed
- All books still download normally
- Users see book information on the website

**Cons:**
- 50% of PDFs won't have the cover page when downloaded
- Less professional presentation

**Cost:** Free

## Help Me Decide – Quick Questions

To recommend the best option for you, please answer these three questions:

**1. How often do you add new PDF books to the library?**
- [ ] Often (monthly or more)
- [ ] Sometimes (a few times per year)
- [ ] Rarely (once a year or less)

**2. How important are cover pages when users download PDFs?**
- [ ] Very important – professional presentation matters
- [ ] Nice to have – useful but not critical
- [ ] Not important – users just need the content

**3. Is storage space on your server a concern?**
- [ ] Yes – we have limited space or it's expensive
- [ ] No – we have plenty of space

## My Recommendation

Based on your answers, here's what I'd suggest:

**If you add PDFs often AND cover pages are important:**
→ **Option 2** (Software license) – Saves time in the long run

**If you rarely add PDFs AND cover pages are important:**
→ **Option 1** (Convert files) – One-time effort, free solution

**If cover pages are nice-to-have but not critical:**
→ **Option 3** (Keep current) – No rush to change anything

## Next Steps

Please let me know:
1. Your answers to the three questions above
2. Which option you'd prefer, or if you'd like more details

I'm happy to discuss this over a call if that would be easier.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

## Technical Note (Optional – can skip)

The issue is that 50% of your PDFs use "Object Streams" (PDF version 1.5+), which is a modern compression technique. Our free tools only support older PDF formats. The conversion process removes this advanced compression from the PDF structure while keeping all content (images, text) intact.
