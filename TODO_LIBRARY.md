# TODO: Library Authentication & User Features

## 📊 Implementation Status (Created: 2025-10-27)

**Overall Progress: 0% (New Requirements)** 🚧

Based on analysis of:
- LIBRARY-PLAN.pdf (customer requirements document)
- conversation.md (customer-developer agreement)
- Current implementation review

---

## 🔴 CRITICAL: Authentication Requirements

### Current Problem
The library is currently **publicly accessible**, which contradicts the agreed requirements:
- Customer requirement: "User must register (or been registered by admin) to have access to library"
- Current state: Anyone can browse library without login

### Required Changes

#### 1. Add Authentication Middleware to Library Routes ❌ **NOT STARTED**

**Objective:** Restrict library access to authenticated users only

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add `auth` middleware to all library routes
- [ ] Add `verified` middleware (optional email verification)
- [ ] Update routes/web.php:
  ```php
  Route::middleware(['auth', 'verified'])->group(function () {
      Route::get('/library', [LibraryController::class, 'index']);
      Route::get('/library/book/{slug}', [LibraryController::class, 'show']);
      Route::get('/library/book/{book}/view-pdf/{file}', [LibraryController::class, 'viewPdf']);
      Route::get('/library/book/{book}/download/{file}', [LibraryController::class, 'download']);
      Route::post('/library/book/{book}/rate', [LibraryController::class, 'submitRating']);
      Route::post('/library/book/{book}/review', [LibraryController::class, 'submitReview']);
      Route::post('/library/book/{book}/request-access', [LibraryController::class, 'requestAccess']);
  });
  ```
- [ ] Test redirect behavior: unauthenticated users → login page
- [ ] Implement "intended URL" redirect after login

**Files to Modify:**
- `routes/web.php`

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Guest users cannot access /library without login
- ✅ Guest users cannot access /library/book/{slug} without login
- ✅ After login, users are redirected to originally requested library page
- ✅ Guide pages remain publicly accessible

---

#### 2. Update Navigation for Auth-Required Library ❌ **NOT STARTED**

**Objective:** Show appropriate library access based on authentication status

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Update header navigation component
- [ ] For guests: Change "Library" link to show login prompt or redirect
- [ ] For authenticated users: Direct access to library
- [ ] Add visual indicator (lock icon?) for library when not logged in
- [ ] Update Guide/Library toggle switch behavior:
  - Guest clicks "Library" → Redirect to login with return URL
  - Authenticated clicks "Library" → Direct access
- [ ] Add "Login to Access Library" call-to-action on Guide pages
- [ ] Update breadcrumbs to handle auth redirects

**Files to Modify:**
- `resources/views/layouts/library.blade.php`
- `resources/views/components/header.blade.php` (if exists)
- Navigation partials

**Design Requirements (from LIBRARY-PLAN.pdf):**
- Library toggle should be present but indicate login required
- Clear visual distinction between accessible (Guide) and restricted (Library) areas

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Guest users see login prompt when clicking Library
- ✅ Authenticated users see direct Library access
- ✅ Visual feedback shows which areas require login
- ✅ No broken links or confusing redirects

---

## 📋 Terms of Use Acceptance System ❌ **NOT STARTED**

### Requirement (from LIBRARY-PLAN.pdf)

## 📞 Questions for Customer

Before starting implementation, clarify:

1. **Terms of Use**: Do you have the terms of use content ready, or should we use a standard template?
2. **Email Verification**: Required or optional for registration?
3. **User Fields**: Any additional user profile fields needed (school, role, location)?
4. **Bookmarks Organization**: Should users be able to organize bookmarks into collections/folders?
5. **Notes**: Should notes be exportable? Any special formatting needed?
6. **Share Analytics**: Should we track share actions for analytics?
7. **Social Login**: Do you want OAuth login (Google, Facebook) in addition to email/password?
8. **User Roles**: Only 'user' and 'admin', or do you need additional roles (e.g., 'moderator', 'teacher')?
9. **Admin User Creation**: Should admin-created users receive passwords via email, or should they set their own?
10. **Terms Updates**: How often will terms be updated? Should we notify users of updates?
