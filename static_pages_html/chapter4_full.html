<h1>LEARNING AND TEACHING STRATEGY—IN DOING ONE LEARNS</h1>

<p>Welcome and thank you for your interest in the FSM Vernacular Language Arts (VLA) This section highlights the island teaching and learning strategy known as "in doing, one learns", also referred to as hands-on or experiential learning. Additional strategies will be discussed in the next section. Traditionally, children in FSM communities learned by being present alongside adults as they worked—whether in canoe houses, cookhouses, on land, or on the ocean. By observing, imitating, and participating, children acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to sustain themselves and their culture. In school, students respond positively to experiential learning activities such as games, field trips, mapping exercises, and community service, which mirror this traditional approach and reinforce learning through active engagement.</p>
