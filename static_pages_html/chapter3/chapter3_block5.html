    <p style="font-size: 0.9em; margin-top: 0.5rem;">Deliberately writing her name all in lowercase in order to emphasize the importance of her ideas over her identity, this groundbreaking thinker and educator argued that classrooms should be engaged, community-based spaces where teachers and students learn together and knowledge is connected to real life.</p>

      knowing when and how to provide information to island communities demands critical and systems thinking. Unlike in the West, expressing personal opinions in the FSM must be done indirectly and subtly—a skill which engages thinking.

    <p>It is clear that the work of sustaining Micronesia's local languages cannot rest on schools alone. Schools need consistent collaboration with families, community organizations, government agencies, and traditional leadership to ensure that these languages remain lived, used, and transmitted. At the same time, students need proficiency in English and other international languages to participate fully in wider economic and educational opportunities. Public education therefore has to engage directly with how languages are learned, how they shape access to jobs and services, and how they connect to culture, identity, and community well-being.</p>
    <p>A language policy becomes meaningful only when it is lived in everyday practice. By bringing schools, families, and communities into genuine partnership, the FSM can support learners who move confidently between local and global worlds. When students see their languages used, valued, and expanded—and when they are invited to take part in that work—they develop the competence and insight needed to contribute to their communities and to the wider world.</p>

    <p>The VLA curriculum cannot be taught in isolation; it must be rooted in the community. The community is rich in local expertise and serves as a living, real-world classroom where meaningful learning occurs. The curriculum encourages students to think critically as they analyze texts, compare and contrast information, and apply knowledge and skills to new situations. Schools and communities play a vital role in providing safe, supportive spaces where languages are actively maintained and practiced.</p>
    <p>Vernacular language arts education encourages skills such as analysis, reasoning, and the transfer of knowledge, all of which require critical and systems thinking. Students learn how to contribute thoughtfully to problem-solving within both schools and communities. When these spaces welcome self-expression, experimentation, creative and collaborative learning, students are more likely to engage deeply in the learning process. Elders, parents, and teachers serve as role models, guiding students to learn from both successes and from errors, while continuing to practice cultural skills and traditions.</p>
    <p>To express personal opinions and navigate cultural expectations, students must first critically reflect on their own practices and the norms of their community. Schools and communities provide the space for them to develop and practice these skills, ensuring that learning is both culturally grounded and intellectually rigorous.</p>

    <p>In a community-based VLA curriculum, students develop language skills that are deeply tied to cultural norms and real-world practices:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Students learn to listen attentively to teachers and elders, asking and answering questions in ways that are respectful and traditionally appropriate.</li>
      <li>They practice the use of proper and respectful language during community activities and service.</li>
      <li>Modern concepts can be explained and discussed in local languages, not only in English, reinforcing the relevance of vernacular languages in daily life.</li>
      <li>Bilingual competence is supported by encouraging local language use at home and in the communities, while English remains important within the school system.</li>
      <li>Students can listen and view a variety of presentations in different settings beyond classrooms—such as community meetings, courtrooms, or legislative chambers—learning to recall information accurately and critique ideas constructively through a cultural lens.</li>
      <li>They develop the judgment to know when to remain quiet and listen attentively to their elders or teachers, and when to speak, always respecting their audience and the setting.</li>
