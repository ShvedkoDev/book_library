    <p>Place-based education is the process of using the local community and environment as a starting point to teach language arts, mathematics, social studies, science and other subjects across the curriculum. Emphasizing hands-on, real-world learning experiences, this approach to education increases academic achievement, helps students develop stronger ties to their community, enhances students' appreciation for the natural world, and creates a heightened commitment to serving as active, contributing citizens. Community vitality and environmental quality are improved through the active engagement of local citizens, community organizations, and environmental resources in the life of the school.</p>

  <div class="collapsible-content toggle-content" id="inMuchOfOceania">
    <p>In much of Oceania, teaching traditionally began with the local community and environment, as described in the writings of Father Hezel and others. With colonization, militarization, and globalization, this approach was gradually replaced by external influences and resources. Today, however, more educators and community members recognize the value of place-based education and are working to restore it as a priority.</p>
    <p>The FSM Language Policy makes a number of recommendations when it comes to the development of educational materials and their use in schools. Specifically, the policy recommends that</p>
    <blockquote style="background-color: #fffacd; border-left: 3px solid #a1b78a; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0; font-style: italic;">
      Materials should be developed in local languages and English to:<br><br>
      1) promote Micronesian customs, beliefs, and values,<br>
      2) promote the development of community role models,<br>
      3) provide content information on the productive sectors (agriculture, marine, and tourism), and,<br>
      4) promote development of National and State identities.
    </blockquote>
    <p>Highlighting the need for Micronesian values, customs, and beliefs as content for school resources, offers opportunities for communities to become more involved in Vernacular Language Arts education. The value of the local environment as the fundamental "textbook" also increases, as students develop a deeper appreciation for and connection to the natural world. Teaching through place encourages students to participate in farming, fishing, and other community activities that support local well-being and sustainability.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="collapsible-content toggle-content" id="usingPlaceAndNatureAs">
    <p>Using place and nature as a "textbook" supports accessible and affordable Vernacular Language Arts education. Teachers and students can "read" the sky, land, and sea to learn the names of places, natural phenomena, stories, living things, and everything else found within them. These "readings" can be interpreted in ways that guide thoughtful, positive decision-making. Before any paper or digital textbooks existed, the place and nature offer us the content and skills for meaningful learning. Engaging with the world and learning in, from, and about specific places encourages respect, deepens connections, and strengthens cultural identity.</p>
    <p>Local industries and productive activities—such as farming, fishing, weaving, cooking, and sewing—provide rich opportunities for teaching students to be active, contributing members of their communities. Each activity comes with its own vocabulary in different languages and many are connected to highly specific place-based knowledge. Even when the physical action is basically the same—for example, digging a hole to plant a tree—the words used to describe it and the nuanced ways it is done in different places can vary. Through these place-based activities, students simultaneously develop practical skills, cultural understanding, and linguistic ability.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="collapsible-content toggle-content" id="ourIslandsLandscapesAndWatersOffer">
    <p>Our islands, landscapes, and waters offer lessons that no printed book can match; by learning directly from place, students gain knowledge that is practical, cultural, and deeply relevant in their lives.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Observing clouds and predicting weather. Students draw what they see and record names and notes in the vernacular language.</li>
      <li>Observing stars, behavior of birds and fish, and movements of currents and tides are all place-based skills that teach about systems, science, language, and the environment.</li>
      <li>Farming and gardening are powerful place-based "teachers." Students learn vocabulary for tools and methods, names of food plants and their varieties, and seasonal farming practices, responsibilities, and feasts that sustain community life.</li>
      <li>Island identity is closely tied to land, including a person's entitlement to a place and how they care for it over time.</li>
      <li>Traditional place names carry deep meaning. Learning and using original names instead of newer, foreign-influenced ones helps students develop stronger ties to their community and better understand its past.</li>
      <li>Fishing teaches ecological understanding. Knowing tides, finding fishing spots, preparing bait, reading the reef, and using traditional methods introduces students to specialized terms and concepts that blend language, science, and cultural protocol. Sharing the catch models community values.</li>
      <li>Traditional building methods teach measurement and design. By observing or helping to build a canoe or house, students learn spatial relationships, counting systems, traditional units, specialized vocabulary, and cultural values embedded in craftsmanship.</li>
      <li>Local ceremonies, dances, storytelling, and cultural celebrations teach history and language. By participating in or documenting these practices, students encounter expressive forms, poetry, and other oral traditions. That deepens their command of the vernacular language and strengthens cultural identity through direct engagement with place.</li>
    </ul>
