    <p>Language is our link with our children, family, community, and the world. Our local languages define our culture, beliefs and identities as Micronesians.</p>

    <p>Language is inextricable from culture. To know language is to know culture and vice versa. All island cultural practices have unique and practical vocabulary. Micronesian languages have rich and highly specific vocabulary to describe island places, culture, and way of life. There are specific terms to describe the environment and living things; define traditional skills such as types of fishing and weaving; explain observations of clouds and ocean currents. We first look to our own island cultures as the main resource for content and skills, before we look to including others.</p>
    <p>A well-known framework in language-policy studies explains three major ways governments and societies think about language: as a right, a problem, or a resource. Each view leads to different policies and outcomes, which can differ widely between different countries.</p>
    <p>When language is seen as a right, it is something people are entitled to and leads to policies that protect everyone's rights to use their own language. Some governments view language as a problem, an obstacle to national unity, schooling, or economic success. They "fix" the problem by suppressing or even banning the use of certain languages to push everyone to use the dominant language. The FSM Language Policy affirms that language is</p>
    <blockquote style="background-color: #fffacd; border-left: 3px solid #8aafcb; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0; font-style: italic;">
      a major resource in economic growth and social development.

    <p>This perspective recognizes that local languages hold cultural capital that strengthens communities and guides sustainable development.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="collapsible-content toggle-content" id="everyCultureHasItsDistinctiveWays">
    <p>Every culture has its distinctive ways of speaking. One can often tell were a person is from simply by listening to the sounds of their language. Yet language is more than sound. Sounds combine into different kinds of words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.) which then form sentences. Each language has its own rules for doing this: syntax (how words are organized), morphology (how words change depending on their function), and semantics (how words and sentences create meaning). From its simplest sounds to its wisest proverbs and poetry, language is profoundly cultural, shaped by generations of practice, change, and creativity.</p>
    <p>It is increasingly concerning that many children in the FSM are no longer fluent in local languages and rely on English in daily life. This is a loss not only of language, but also of cultural identity. The FSM Vernacular Language Arts curriculum is designed to help reverse this trend and restore the linguistic and cultural balance at the heart of island life.</p>
    <p>Cultural skills include appropriate ways of speaking, presenting, and listening. These practices support not only language learning, but also community building and a deeper sense of island identity. Culture should be understood as deeply valuable—far more than money or goods. It is a precious store of collective insight, experience, and wisdom. In Vernacular Language Arts, culture is the first and most important resource to draw upon. As with money, it is better to rely on what we already have than to borrow from elsewhere. Yet unlike bank accounts, cultural resources grow richer the more we use them for teaching and learning. That strengthens our cultural capital, which then extends its benefits to other areas of life, including environmental stewardship and economic development.</p>

    <p>Here are some examples on how we draw on our culture as a "bank" for our knowledge and skills.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Learning mathematics begins with counting and classifying objects—our languages offer well-defined counting systems for things that differ in type, shape, or usage.</li>
      <li>All learning, problem-solving, and decision-making rely on our ability to recognize patterns—and our culture, from weaving mats and baskets to observing seasonal changes for agriculture, is itself a vast practice of pattern recognition.</li>
      <li>Our ability to sustain ourselves is rooted in our indigenous agricultural systems—be it from taro patches to make food for the family, farming of yams or other prestige crops to improve standing in the community, or production and sale of copra to earn money.</li>
      <li>Catching a fish to eat may sound simple but it is not—we draw from our cultural experience to prepare the right tools and bait, choose the best time and place, and use the necessary methods and skills.</li>
      <li>How we show respect to other people and how we earn to be respected by others also depends on our culture—knowing proper ways of speaking and when and how to use them, learning names of places and their stories, knowing our genealogies and community history, applying the right knowledge for the correct occasions.</li>
      <li>Our language is filled with clues to what our culture values—for example, unique vocabulary and expressions about life-sustaining crops differ from simple, everyday speech. On many atolls, the right word to describe eating pandanus is not the same word used to describe eating other foods.</li>
