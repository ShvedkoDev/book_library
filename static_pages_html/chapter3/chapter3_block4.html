    <p>The FSM Language Policy recognizes that children</p>
    <blockquote style="background-color: #fffacd; border-left: 3px solid #a5a5c7; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0; font-style: italic;">
      should have materials in their local languages for study in school

    <p>and that their introduction to English and any other foreign languages should be</p>
    <blockquote style="background-color: #fffacd; border-left: 3px solid #a5a5c7; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0; font-style: italic;">
      through materials which are appropriate for students' age, cultural setting, and in line with economic and social realities in the FSM.

    <p>It also suggests that</p>
    <blockquote style="background-color: #fffacd; border-left: 3px solid #a5a5c7; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0; font-style: italic;">
      competence in the primary State language should be an entry requirement into high school and should be incorporated into high school entrance tests.
    </blockquote>
    <p>To empower students to meet those needs, the policy envisions them as active creators of their own resources. The idea is that students develop writing and presentation skills needed to co-create vernacular language resources alongside their educators:</p>
    <blockquote style="background-color: #fffacd; border-left: 3px solid #a5a5c7; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0; font-style: italic;">
      Innovative processes should be used for materials development. Students, teachers, other government agencies, and COM-FSM students should all be considered as potential writers and materials developers.
    </blockquote>
    <p>Teachers, schools, and communities can guide the creation of these resources, while students take an active role as creators. State and local governments, as well as local non-governmental organizations, can provide financial support to publish and distribute the student-developed resources.</p>
    <p>As mentioned in the introduction of this guide, students are deeply influenced by what they read, see and watch. By encouraging and supporting students to develop resources in their own languages, we are also nurturing the next generation of educators, leaders, and custodians of island cultures and identities.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="collapsible-content toggle-content" id="asStatedInTheFsmLanguagePolicy">
    <p>As stated in the FSM Language Policy, students and teachers should all be considered as potential writers and materials developers. Therefore, VLA teaching and learning practices should empower students to recognize and produce high-quality performances and materials. Older students can model creativity and effective practices for younger students, building leadership skills while helping to perpetuate island culture. The resources created by students can be shared with other learners and serve as samples for producing even more local materials.</p>
    <p>Students represent an untapped well of creativity and knowledge. During the development of this guide and its accompanying repository of VLA resources, the authors encountered several student-written books containing retellings of local legends and stories. These hidden treasures were often the only printed copies of stories traditionally passed down orally. As more elders pass away, these narratives could be lost if not for the dedication of students and their teachers.</p>
    <p>By actively engaging students in resource creation, schools can ensure that cultural knowledge is being effectively shared and revitalized, while also increasing the quality and scope of educational materials available to them. Each student-created resource not only strengthens learning but also cultivates a sense of pride, ownership, and responsibility for sustaining FSM's rich linguistic and cultural heritage.</p>

    <p>When schools help students move between their own local vernacular languages and the larger, more dominant languages used at the state, national, and international levels, students gain the skills and confidence to use all of their languages together in meaningful ways.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Children can share what they learn in beautiful, creative, and authentic student-made works. Children are naturally imaginative; the VLA curriculum can harness these innate gifts to build strong competencies, varied skills, and valuable resources in many creative ways.</li>
      <li>Material creation does not need to be limited to adults or experts. Students themselves can play a major role as creators and contributors to their cultural learning environment.</li>
      <li>Students can take part in producing cultural resources in their local languages. They can write songs, create artwork, produce videos, or retell legends and stories from their communities.</li>
      <li>Students can also co-develop new words and terms in FSM languages to express emerging concepts in science, economics, and technology—helping their languages grow alongside new knowledge.</li>
      <li>They can create sector-specific resources, such as farming and fishing manuals, pamphlets, and brochures that support community livelihoods.</li>
      <li>Most importantly, students can help document the wisdom and knowledge of elders before it is lost, preserving traditions and stories for future generations.</li>
