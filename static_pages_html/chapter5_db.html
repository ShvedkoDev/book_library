<h1><strong>GENERAL TEACHING AND ASSESSMENT TOOLS FOR ALL STANDARDS</strong></h1>
<p>The following section presents a variety of practical teaching and assessment tools, strategies, and culturally relevant approaches designed to help you and your students meet specific grade standards and benchmarks. (Some have been combined for clarity, as their content closely overlaps.)</p>
<p>Many of the sample materials provided in this <em><strong>Resource Guide</strong></em> can be printed, copied, and used directly in the classroom. However, we encourage teachers to adapt and modify these tools, strategies, and approaches to suit their own classrooms and contexts. In addition, we reference a small selection of resources from the <em><strong>Resource Library</strong></em>, but this is as examples only. The library contains hundreds of diverse materials and we hope teachers will enjoy exploring them and putting them to good use.</p>
