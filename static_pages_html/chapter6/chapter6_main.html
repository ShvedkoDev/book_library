<h1>GENERAL TEACHING AND ASSESSMENT TOOLS FOR ALL STANDARDS</h1>
<p>The following section presents a
    variety of practical teaching and assessment tools, strategies, and culturally relevant approaches designed to help
    you and your students meet specific grade standards and benchmarks. (Some have been combined for clarity, as their
    content closely overlaps.)</p>
<p>Many of the sample materials provided in this <strong><em>Resource
    Guide</em></strong> can be printed, copied, and used directly in the classroom. However, we encourage teachers to
    adapt and modify these tools, strategies, and approaches to suit their own classrooms and contexts. In addition, we
    reference a small selection of resources from the <strong><em>Resource Library</em></strong>, but this is as
    examples only. The library contains hundreds of diverse materials and we hope teachers will enjoy exploring them and
    putting them to good use.</p>
