<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1><p>Welcome and thank you for your interest in the <strong>FSM Vernacular Language Arts (VLA)
    curriculum</strong>!</p><p>The goal of the VLA curriculum is to create a supportive environment where students can
    learn and grow in their native language, while fostering cultural pride and understanding. Within this framework,
    students develop the critical skills needed to move confidently between different cultures, settings, and learning
    opportunities.</p><p>This online guide promotes a clear, shared understanding among teachers, students, parents, and the wider
    community
    of how the VLA curriculum is implemented in classrooms. It aims to equip teachers with practical tools,
    resources, strategies, and culturally relevant approaches that honor Micronesia’s rich linguistic and cultural
    heritage.
    In doing so, it supports teachers in creating learning environments where students thrive academically and
    strengthen their identities as stewards of their culture.</p><h2 id="importance-of-the-vla-curriculum">IMPORTANCE OF THE VLA CURRICULUM</h2><p>A very revealing and important TED Talk by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie titled
    <em>The Danger of a Single Story </em>tells a
    story that resonates with many people in the FSM and throughout the Pacific Islands. As a child,
    this renowned Nigerian author read books in English, as very few were available in her mother tongue.
    Over time, she began to identify with Western ways depicted in the books instead of the Nigerian ways of her own
    culture and place.</p><p>The <strong>FSM Language Policy</strong> recognizes a similar problem. A review of available English materials
    found them unsuitable
    for instructional purposes, with role model portrayal, language use, and topical issues inappropriate for
    instruction at early grades.
    It clearly states that the "materials themselves convey a different set of values and attitudes from what we feel
    should be emphasized in our early education system."</p><h2 id="support-for-the-vla-curriculum">SUPPORT FOR THE VLA CURRICULUM</h2><p>As educators, we are tasked with delivering the <strong>Vernacular Language
    Arts (VLA) curriculum</strong>all over the FSM. This is a daunting task because local resources are limited, and we are inundated with external
    materials.
    This <strong><em>Resource guide</em></strong> aims to support educators in thinking about and using one's own places
    and cultures as teaching and learning resources.
    It reminds users to turn first to what is local and accessible, as this will support student learning without having
    to cross cultural barriers.
    Finally, it acknowledges that the teachers, students, families, and communities are all their own amazing resources
    and their knowledge and experience
    offer “toolkits” for teaching the precious knowledge of Micronesian languages, cultures, and practices.
    Nevertheless, books, stories, and other written materials remain
    essential parts of a modern education system and our teachers must be equipped to use them. For that reason,
    this guide is accompanied by an online <strong><em>Resource library</em></strong>, envisioned as a comprehensive
    repository of all available
    educational materials in Micronesian languages, never before so accessible.</p><h2 id="created-through-partnership">CREATED THROUGH PARTNERSHIP</h2><p>This project was initiated by FSM Department of Education and implemented by
    Island Research &amp; Education Initiative (iREi) in partnership with Centre for Getting Things Started (C4GTS),
    along with the many individuals, partners, and colleagues whose contributions are gratefully acknowledged here.</p><p></p><div class="resource-guide-special-block">

    <p>The effort to implement this project was coordinated by Lilly Abraham Jonathan of FSM Department
        of Education (FSM DOE) and led by Danko Taborosi of Island Research &amp; Education Initiative (iREi) and Koh
        Ming
        Wei of Centre for Getting Things Started (C4GTS). Many partners, friends, and colleagues supported the effort of
        co-creating this guide and the online library of VLA resources. They helped by looking for materials in
        libraries,
        schools, and even in old storage sheds. They carefully scanned delicate pages of old books and articles. And
        they
        jumped in when we needed help in loosely translating book titles in the many languages of Micronesia. While we
        list
        some of them below, we apologize in advance if we may have forgotten someone and ask that you forgive us. Do

        <p>This <strong><em>Resource Guide</em></strong> opens with a <a href="/framework">guiding framework</a> that
            provides an overarching perspective on Vernacular Language Arts. It then applies this framework to <a href="/principles">principles of
                place-based education</a>. Next, the guide presents experiential <a href="/strategy">learning and
                teaching strategies</a> and suggests ways to adapt them to support curriculum
            delivery. Color-coding highlights thematic links among the framework, principles, and strategies, helping
            teachers
            stay mindful of the four recurring themes throughout the VLA curriculum and keep them central in planning
            and
            practice.</p>
        <p>After reviewing the above parts individually or with colleagues, teachers may hold small-group
            discussions and revisit these core parts of the guide. Using the objectives in the <a href="/framework">guiding
                framework</a>,
            they can explore what place-based education means in their local context and
            compare their reflections with the fundamental <a href="/principles">principles of place-based education</a>.
            Following these discussions, teachers can engage with the <a href="/strategy">learning and teaching
                strategies</a>.</p>
        <p>Having explored the above sections thoroughly and inspired by ideas

        <p>Teachers will also
            want to examine the range of available <a href="/toolkit">sample teaching and assessment tools</a>, which
            they
            print out and use directly or modify for their needs. Though the "toolkit" has a variety of materials, many
            additional examples and resources exist beyond those included and will continue to emerge as teachers
            communicate
            and collaborate.</p>
        <p>Teachers are invited to refer to the <a href="/glossary">glossary</a> whenever they come

        <p>The <strong><em>Resource library</em></strong> supporting the National Vernacular Language Arts curriculum is a
            comprehensive,
            well-organized online repository of place-based educational materials. Freely accessible to all at
            <a href="https://micronesian.school/library">https://micronesian.school/library</a>, it provides instant access
            to a
            curated collection of books and learning
            resources – especially those developed in the diverse vernacular languages of Micronesia.</p>
        <p>Designed for teachers,
            educators, and anyone interested in Micronesian culture, language, literacy, and education, the library allows
            users
            to view, comment on, annotate, download, and make use of nearly 2,000 resources collected to date. It serves as
            both
            a practical teaching tool and a growing digital archive that supports culturally grounded learning across the
            region.</p>
        <h3>GETTING STARTED — HOW TO ACCESS THE LIBRARY</h3>
        <p>To access the <strong><em>Resource library</em></strong>, use the switch at the top of this page and select the
            option on the right.</p>
        <img src="/storage/page-media/Picture2.png">
        <p>To get back to this <strong><em>Resource library</em></strong>, click the left side of the same switch button.
        </p>

        <h3>LOCATING RESOURCES – HOW TO FIND WHAT YOU NEED</h3>
        <p>Once you enter the
            library page, the system will display the full list of all available resources by default. Use the following
            options
            lined up on the left to find materials:</p>
        <h4>1. Search</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Use the "Keyword search" box to look for resources
                by title, author, subject, or any other keyword. The search tool is broad and highly flexible. It retrieves
                any
                item
                whose metadata contains the letter sequence you enter, regardless of where they appear. This makes it easy
                to
                find
                materials even with partial words. If you are unsure of spellings, you can enter just the part of the word
                you
                know
                is correct.<br>

            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>2. Browse</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Whether viewing the full collection or search results, you can use the "Number
                of entries" option to select how many items should be displayed on the screen at one time.
                <br>
                <img src="/storage/page-media/Picture4.png">
            </li>

            <li>If there are
                more
                resources available to view than fit on one page as per your settings, click page numbers at the bottom of
                the

        <ul>
            <li>If you are seeing too many titles and want to narrow them down to
                match your needs, you can use one or more of the "Filter results" options.

        <ul>
            <li>Clicking any of the filter boxes
                will reveal a variety of options you can select. For example, you can filter by purpose (e.g. "Concept
                materials",
                "Literacy development", "Knowledge expansion"), by type (e.g. "Fictional story", "Folk tale", "Science",
                "Animal
                story", "Everyday story" etc.), and by language (e.g., "Yapese", "Satawalese", "Chuukese", "Mortlockese",
                "Pohnpeian", "Nukuoro", "Kosraean", etc.).
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>You can select multiple options simultaneously. For example, you
                can immediately narrow down the list of available resources to show "Literacy development" materials that
                are
                also
                "Legends" and in "Chuukese" language. This helps if you're seeking resources suitable for a specific
                language,
                grade
                or teaching objective.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>4. Sort</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>At any time, you can use the "Sort by" option to arrange the displayed
                list of available resources alphabetically by title, chronologically by publication date, and by popularity
                (with
                most viewed items shown first).

        <h4>PROVIDING FEEDBACK – HOW TO KEEP TRACK AND HELP OTHERS</h4>
        <p>
            Once you have had some experience with a particular
            resource—whether for your personal interest or for classroom use with students—you will likely form an
            opinion
            about
            it. You may find it excellent for a particular purpose, useful with some limitations, or unsuitable for your
            needs.
            In that case, you are welcome to provide feedback about it. This feedback can be in the form of a rating,
            review, or
            notes.
        </p>
        <h4>1. Rate resources</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>You can rate a resource by clicking the appropriate number of stars you feel
                it deserves, with the 5-star rating being the best.
                <br>
                <img src="/storage/page-media/Picture16.png">
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Once you click the number of stars you want to assign to a
                resource, your mark will be combined with those of other users to produce the overall rating for that
                particular
                resource. This helps users get a sense of how a particular resource is valued by others.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>You can change the
                rating you give to a book at any time by clicking a different star.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>You can remove your rating altogether at
                any time by clicking the same star.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>2. Review resources</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <div style="display: flex;">
                    <p style="flex: 1;">You are welcome to write a review of any
                        resource. To do so, please click the "Review" button. Your feedback helps other educators understand how
                        the
                        material works in real classrooms, making it easier for them to choose tools that fit their needs.</p>
                    <p style="margin:0;">
                        <img src="/storage/page-media/Picture17.png" style="margin:0;">
                    </p>
                </div>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>A helpful
                review briefly describes how you used the resource, notes its strengths, and points out any limitations or
                areas
                for
                improvement. Thoughtful reviews provide practical insights into the usefulness, clarity, and VLA and
                cultural
                relevance of the material.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>3. Write notes to self</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <div style="display: flex;">
                    <p style="flex: 1;">We know that sometimes you want to write your
                        opinion about a resource, but do not wish to share it with others. For that purpose, you have the option of
                        writing
                        notes to self, by clicking the "Notes" button.</p>
                    <p style="margin:0;">
                        <img src="/storage/page-media/Picture18.png" style="margin:0;">
                    </p>
                </div>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>These notes are visible only to yourself and allow you to
                record quick reminders about how you might use a resource in the future or what to adjust next time.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>4. Share and bookmark resources</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <div style="display: flex;">
                    <p style="flex: 1;">You may also want to share a resource with another teacher who would benefit from it—simply click the
                        "Share"
                        button
                        and either copy the direct link to send by email or message, or share the
                        provided QR code.</p>
                    <p style="margin:0;">
                        <img src="/storage/page-media/Picture19.png" style="margin:0;">
                    </p>
                </div>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>You can also save a resource for easy access later by clicking the 'Bookmark' button.<br><img src="/storage/page-media/Picture20.png"></li>
        </ul>
        <h4>REGISTRATION AND LOG IN – HOW TO MAKE THE MOST OF IT</h4>
        <p>Some of the options described above—specifically
            download, ratings, reviews, notes, and bookmarks—are available only to registered users. You must be logged in
            to
            access these features. The first time you try to use any of them, or when you click the "Log in", you will be
            prompted to log in or register.</p>
        <img src="/storage/page-media/Picture21.png">
        <ul>
            <li>Registration is simple and requires only your name, email address, and a
                password you create.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>If you don't have an email address, you can use a non-working one and you will still be
                able to register and fully access all site features. This flexibility ensures that teachers who do not
                regularly
                use
                email can still access the site. Please note that without a working email, you cannot reset your password if
                forgotten.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>We hope you will take full advantage of the Resource library, enjoy exploring it, and make use of
            its books and other educational materials to support your interests and teaching needs.</p>
