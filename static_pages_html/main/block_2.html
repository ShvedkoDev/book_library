        <p>This <strong><em>Resource Guide</em></strong> opens with a <a href="/framework">guiding framework</a> that
            provides an overarching perspective on Vernacular Language Arts. It then applies this framework to <a
                    href="/principles">principles of
                place-based education</a>. Next, the guide presents experiential <a href="/strategy">learning and
                teaching strategies</a> and suggests ways to adapt them to support curriculum
            delivery. Color-coding highlights thematic links among the framework, principles, and strategies, helping
            teachers
            stay mindful of the four recurring themes throughout the VLA curriculum and keep them central in planning
            and
            practice.</p>
        <p>After reviewing the above parts individually or with colleagues, teachers may hold small-group
            discussions and revisit these core parts of the guide. Using the objectives in the <a href="/framework">guiding
                framework</a>,
            they can explore what place-based education means in their local context and
            compare their reflections with the fundamental <a href="/principles">principles of place-based education</a>.
            Following these discussions, teachers can engage with the <a href="/strategy">learning and teaching
                strategies</a>.</p>
        <p>Having explored the above sections thoroughly and inspired by ideas
            generated through collaboration, educators can consider <a href="/applying-by-styandard">applying the
                teaching
                and learning strategies to the
                framework and principles, organized by standard</a>.</p>
        <p>Teachers will also
            want to examine the range of available <a href="/toolkit">sample teaching and assessment tools</a>, which
            they
            print out and use directly or modify for their needs. Though the "toolkit" has a variety of materials, many
            additional examples and resources exist beyond those included and will continue to emerge as teachers
            communicate
            and collaborate.</p>
        <p>Teachers are invited to refer to the <a href="/glossary">glossary</a> whenever they come
            across unfamiliar terms in this guide, the FSM VLA curriculum, or the <a href="/references">recommended
                readings
                and references</a>.</p>
        <p>Finally, before beginning their first search for available VLA materials, teachers are
            encouraged to consult the guidance below on how to use the Resource Library effectively.</p>
