        <p>The effort to implement this project was coordinated by Lilly Abraham Jonathan of FSM Department
            of Education (FSM DOE) and led by Danko Taborosi of Island Research &amp; Education Initiative (iREi) and Koh
            Ming
            Wei of Center for Getting Things Started (C4GTS). Many partners, friends, and colleagues supported the effort of
            co-creating this guide and the online library of VLA resources. They helped by looking for materials in
            libraries,
            schools, and even in old storage sheds. They carefully scanned delicate pages of old books and articles. And
            they
            jumped in when we needed help in loosely translating book titles in the many languages of Micronesia. While we
            list
            some of them below, we apologize in advance if we may have forgotten someone and ask that you forgive us. Do
            know
            that we are very grateful for each and every one of you.</p>
