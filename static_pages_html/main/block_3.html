        <p>The <strong><em>Resource library</em></strong> supporting the National Vernacular Language Arts curriculum is a
            comprehensive,
            well-organized online repository of place-based educational materials. Freely accessible to all at
            <a href="https://micronesian.school/library">https://micronesian.school/library</a>, it provides instant access
            to a
            curated collection of books and learning
            resources &ndash; especially those developed in the diverse vernacular languages of Micronesia.</p>
        <p>Designed for teachers,
            educators, and anyone interested in Micronesian culture, language, literacy, and education, the library allows
            users
            to view, comment on, annotate, download, and make use of nearly 2,000 resources collected to date. It serves as
            both
            a practical teaching tool and a growing digital archive that supports culturally grounded learning across the
            region.</p>
        <h3>GETTING STARTED — HOW TO ACCESS THE LIBRARY</h3>
        <p>To access the <strong><em>Resource library</em></strong>, use the switch at the top of this page and select the
            option on the right.</p>
        <img src="/storage/page-media/Picture2.png">
        <p>To get back to this <strong><em>Resource library</em></strong>, click the left side of the same switch button.
        </p>

        <h3>LOCATING RESOURCES &ndash; HOW TO FIND WHAT YOU NEED</h3>
        <p>Once you enter the
            library page, the system will display the full list of all available resources by default. Use the following
            options
            lined up on the left to find materials:</p>
        <h4>1. Search</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Use the "Keyword search" box to look for resources
                by title, author, subject, or any other keyword. The search tool is broad and highly flexible. It retrieves
                any
                item
                whose metadata contains the letter sequence you enter, regardless of where they appear. This makes it easy
                to
                find
                materials even with partial words. If you are unsure of spellings, you can enter just the part of the word
                you
                know
                is correct.<br>
                <img src="/storage/page-media/Picture3.png">
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>2. Browse</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Whether viewing the full collection or search results, you can use the "Number
                of entries" option to select how many items should be displayed on the screen at one time.
                <br>
                <img src="/storage/page-media/Picture4.png">
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>If there are
                more
                resources available to view than fit on one page as per your settings, click page numbers at the bottom of
                the
                resource list to browse.<br>
                <img src="/storage/page-media/Picture5.png">
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>3. Filter</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>If you are seeing too many titles and want to narrow them down to
                match your needs, you can use one or more of the "Filter results" options.
                <br>
                <img src="/storage/page-media/Picture6.png">
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Clicking any of the filter boxes
                will reveal a variety of options you can select. For example, you can filter by purpose (e.g. "Concept
                materials",
                "Literacy development", "Knowledge expansion"), by type (e.g. "Fictional story", "Folk tale", "Science",
                "Animal
                story", "Everyday story" etc.), and by language (e.g., "Yapese", "Satawalese", "Chuukese", "Mortlockese",
                "Pohnpeian", "Nukuoro", "Kosraean", etc.).
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>You can select multiple options simultaneously. For example, you
                can immediately narrow down the list of available resources to show "Literacy development" materials that
                are
                also
                "Legends" and in "Chuukese" language. This helps if you're seeking resources suitable for a specific
                language,
                grade
                or teaching objective.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>4. Sort</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>At any time, you can use the "Sort by" option to arrange the displayed
                list of available resources alphabetically by title, chronologically by publication date, and by popularity
                (with
                most viewed items shown first).
                <br>
                <img src="/storage/page-media/Picture7.png">
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>5. Locate</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>When you have found the resource you want to examine, click
                the "Locate" button to open a new page with more options and details about.

        <h3>ACCESSING RESOURCES &ndash; HOW TO EXAMINE AND USE THE MATERIALS</h3>
        <p>Once you find a resource of interest, you can view it in detail.</p>
        <h4>1. Understand availability</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>When resources are displayed as a list, they show only the title, publication year,
                purpose, language, and cover page, if available.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>The only other information shown is the status of each
                resource, indicated as follows:<br>
                <img src="/storage/page-media/Picture9.png">
                <img src="/storage/page-media/Picture10.png">
                <img src="/storage/page-media/Picture11.png">
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>"Full access" materials represent the bulk of resources in the digital library
                and can all be downloaded. "Limited access" materials are available for online viewing but not download.
                "Unavailable" resources appear in the digital library catalog for reference, but their content cannot be
                viewed
                or
                downloaded because of copyright limitations.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>2. Get more information</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>You can click the "Locate" button for any resource irrespective of the status. This will take you to a new
                page
                with more information about the
                resource and available options to view and download.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Each resource in the library has its own page with all
                available information about it. To help with navigating, the page is divided into several sections.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                "Overview"
                part presents the key information about the resource and a brief description of it. It also indicates
                how
                other
                library users interacted with it: views, downloads, ratings, and reviews.

            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>In the "Overview" part, the names of
                authors and contributors are clickable. Clicking any name will take the user to the library search page
                where
                only
                books by that person are shown. This is an easy way to find all resources created by a particular
                individual.

            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>"Library locations" part offers direct
                links to that same resource as may be available in the major regional libraries: College of Micronesia -
                FSM,
                University of Hawai'i, the Micronesian Seminar, and University of Guam. This is very helpful for anyone
                looking
                for
                a physical copy of a resource.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>"Related books" presents lists of other editions of the same book, additional
                versions of the book in other languages, and any accompanying materials such as teacher's guides, workbooks,
                etc.

        <ul>
            <li>"User feedback" part offers educators and other users of the library to rate their perceived quality of
                the resource, write a public review, or enter private notes about it.

        <ul>
            <li>If one of both of these options are
                lacking for a particular resource, it means that the resource is restricted or unavailable. In that case,
                you
                are
                welcome to reach out to us for more information and we'll do our best to help you find it elsewhere.

        <h4>PROVIDING FEEDBACK &ndash; HOW TO KEEP TRACK AND HELP OTHERS</h4>
        <p>
            Once you have had some experience with a particular
            resource—whether for your personal interest or for classroom use with students—you will likely form an
            opinion
            about
            it. You may find it excellent for a particular purpose, useful with some limitations, or unsuitable for your
            needs.
            In that case, you are welcome to provide feedback about it. This feedback can be in the form of a rating,
            review, or
            notes.
        </p>
        <h4>1. Rate resources</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>You can rate a resource by clicking the appropriate number of stars you feel
                it deserves, with the 5-star rating being the best.
                <br>
                <img src="/storage/page-media/Picture16.png">
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Once you click the number of stars you want to assign to a
                resource, your mark will be combined with those of other users to produce the overall rating for that
                particular
                resource. This helps users get a sense of how a particular resource is valued by others.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>You can change the
                rating you give to a book at any time by clicking a different star.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>You can remove your rating altogether at
                any time by clicking the same star.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>2. Review resources</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <div style="display: flex;">
                    <p style="flex: 1;">You are welcome to write a review of any
                        resource. To do so, please click the "Review" button. Your feedback helps other educators understand how
                        the
                        material works in real classrooms, making it easier for them to choose tools that fit their needs.</p>
                    <p style="margin:0;">
                        <img src="/storage/page-media/Picture17.png" style="margin:0;">
                    </p>
                </div>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>A helpful
                review briefly describes how you used the resource, notes its strengths, and points out any limitations or
                areas
                for
                improvement. Thoughtful reviews provide practical insights into the usefulness, clarity, and VLA and
                cultural
                relevance of the material.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>3. Write notes to self</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <div style="display: flex;">
                    <p style="flex: 1;">We know that sometimes you want to write your
                        opinion about a resource, but do not wish to share it with others. For that purpose, you have the option of
                        writing
                        notes to self, by clicking the "Notes" button.</p>

            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>These notes are visible only to yourself and allow you to
                record quick reminders about how you might use a resource in the future or what to adjust next time.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>4. Share and bookmark resources</h4>
        <ul>

                <div style="display: flex;">
                    <p style="flex: 1;">You may also want to share a resource with another teacher who would benefit from it—simply click the
                        "Share"
                        button
                        and either copy the direct link to send by email or message, or share the

        <h4>REGISTRATION AND LOG IN &ndash; HOW TO MAKE THE MOST OF IT</h4>
        <p>Some of the options described above—specifically
            download, ratings, reviews, notes, and bookmarks—are available only to registered users. You must be logged in
            to
            access these features. The first time you try to use any of them, or when you click the "Log in", you will be
            prompted to log in or register.</p>
        <img src="/storage/page-media/Picture21.png">
        <ul>
            <li>Registration is simple and requires only your name, email address, and a
                password you create.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>If you don't have an email address, you can use a non-working one and you will still be
                able to register and fully access all site features. This flexibility ensures that teachers who do not
                regularly
                use
                email can still access the site. Please note that without a working email, you cannot reset your password if
                forgotten.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>We hope you will take full advantage of the Resource library, enjoy exploring it, and make use of
            its books and other educational materials to support your interests and teaching needs.</p>
