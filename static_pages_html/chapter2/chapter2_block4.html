    <div class="collapsible-content toggle-content" id="studentsNeedBothSocialAndEmotional">
        <p>Students need both social and emotional learning (SEL) skills and academic mindsets to succeed in college, careers, and communities, both locally and globally. When students are grounded in their home culture and language, they become reflections of their islands and communities. This sense of identity provides strength and stability at school and beyond.</p>
        <p>The FSM Language Policy acknowledges that achieving this is not easy:</p>
        <blockquote style="background-color: #fffacd; border-left: 3px solid #a5a5c7; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0; font-style: italic;">
            One principle we feel is valid is that the content of materials can greatly influence the attitudes and values of our youth. Materials content can be a positive or negative influence on development of values and attitudes, decisions on appropriate careers [even what should be considered a career], and conveying the worth of items and ideas. Today, our children are faced with instructional materials which do not emphasize our cultural heritage, do not promote the development of role models from our local communities, and do not emphasize the productive sectors [agriculture, marine, tourism, and commerce and industry] as seen in the policy directives of the Economic Summits.
        </blockquote>
        <p>The document goes on to ask:</p>
        <blockquote style="background-color: #fffacd; border-left: 3px solid #a5a5c7; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0; font-style: italic;">
            How can language and culture issues be a driving force in improving the quality of life of our citizens both from financial and social standpoints?
        </blockquote>
        <p>Clearly, the FSM Language Policy recognizes social aspects of language arts as vital to community building. Language skills such as listening attentively, speaking respectfully, and presenting thoughtfully foster cultural pride and understanding. Students who are given ways to express themselves within their cultures can use these skills to strengthen their communities and help them progress.</p>

        <h4 style="color: #a5a5c7;" data-toggle="languageArtsPracticesIncludeSkills">PRACTICE</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="collapsible-content toggle-content" id="languageArtsPracticesIncludeSkills">
        <p>Language arts practices include skills such as listening, speaking, reading, and writing, which go hand-in-hand with analyzing what has been heard or read to gain understanding. When students gain understanding of content, they can appreciate what they have learned and apply that knowledge to different contexts within their communities. The ability to use these skills across settings helps shape well-rounded students, which in turn strengthens the community as a whole.</p>
        <p>Cultural tales and idioms offer students rich ways to express their feelings and emotions. For example, a specific local tree may symbolize strength, while a school of particular fish can serve as a metaphor for cooperation and teamwork. Students can reflect on how different living things appear in local wisdom and experiment with creating new sayings or proverbs. They can even write new stories using characters from traditional legends to explore themes of change, adaptation, and mobility, connecting past knowledge with contemporary experiences.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, learning about their mother tongues and cultures in language arts classes helps students see their identities reflected in their formal schooling. By discussing, reading, and writing about familiar cultural experiences, students see their heritage as a relevant part of their education and gain confidence in their value as members of the community. This process also fosters intergenerational connections, as students draw on knowledge from elders and community members, ensuring that cultural knowledge is shared, preserved, and valued across generations.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="collapsible-content toggle-content" id="inLanguageArtsClasses">
        <p>In language arts classes, students develop practical language skills that link school learning with strengthening their communities at home. Examples include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Listening attentively to the teacher with respect and responding or asking questions in a traditionally appropriate manner.</li>
            <li>Knowing local sayings, proverbs, and idioms and understanding when and how to use them.</li>
            <li>Learning and using the names of local places, plants, and animals important to the community.</li>
            <li>Learning and performing traditional dances and chants to mark special events in the community or represent the community on different occasions.</li>
            <li>Perpetuating the use of local languages for simple everyday concepts, such as "open" or "close," instead of using English.</li>
            <li>Co-developing words in local languages for new and complex concepts.</li>
            <li>Engaging in storytelling or oral history sessions with elders to promote and preserve cultural knowledge.</li>
            <li>Using descriptive local language to explain natural phenomena, such as tides, weather, or animal behavior.</li>
            <li>Collaborating with peers to write and perform short skits or dialogues that reflect traditional customs or daily life in the community.</li>
