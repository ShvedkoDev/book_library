        <h3 style="color: #8aafcb;">CULTURE</h3>
        <p>A particular language points to the culture of a particular social group. Learning a language, therefore, is not only learning the alphabet, the meaning, the grammar rules and the arrangement of words, but it is also learning the behavior of the society and its cultural customs. Thus, language teaching should always contain some explicit reference to the culture, the whole from which the particular language is extracted.</p>

        <h4 style="color: #8aafcb;">POLICY</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
        <p>There is a strong connection between a person's heritage and language, and their individual sense of identity. Language carries the culture, customs, and ways of knowing within a community. These elements shape how societies interact with—and understand—the outside world. Mastering vernacular languages helps individuals remain connected to the customs, values, and beliefs passed down through generations. It also allows cultural expressions such as folklore, music, literature, and art to be experienced in their original form, without alteration through translation.</p>
        <p>This relationship is formally recognized in the FSM Language Policy, which also warns of a serious threat:</p>
        <blockquote style="background-color: #fffacd; border-left: 3px solid #8aafcb; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0; font-style: italic;">
            Our patterns of first language acquisition have changed in much of our Nation. No longer do our youth learn language by listening to their elders conveying the history, legends, and myths of our islands. It should also be remembered that these legends, myths and fables conveyed much of our traditional values and cultures so youth were learning far more than just language.
        </blockquote>
        <p>Given these concerns, it is especially important to consider how students interact with others on the global scale. The Internet now makes it easier than ever for young people to access the languages and practices of other places. While learning about other cultures is not inherently negative, such exposure should be grounded in local knowledge and traditions. This ensures that students understand who they are as Micronesian islanders first, before integrating additional values and beliefs from elsewhere.</p>

        <h4 style="color: #8aafcb;">PRACTICE</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
        <p>Cultural traditions and customs are the thread that weaves a community together. In Vernacular Language Arts, these traditions and customs should be used as familiar reference points that help students connect learning to their lived experiences. When students use language arts skills—such as listening, analyzing, and reasoning—to explore cultural practices, they engage more deeply and develop a stronger understanding of both language and identity.</p>
        <p>For example, many cultures across the FSM observe celebrations and customs in which chiefs are honored with the first and best harvests. This practice of chiefly gifting promotes sustainable agricultural methods and careful stewardship of the land, while offering meaningful opportunities to individuals to strengthen their prestige in the community. With each method or practice rich with its own specialized vocabulary, it also provides opportunities to students who study them to strengthen confidence in their own language abilities.</p>
        <p>In addition, integrating cultural knowledge into the curriculum helps students see how language, values, and community responsibilities are interconnected. When students learn the terminology, stories, and principles behind traditional practices, they not only expand their vocabulary but also develop respect for the knowledge systems that have sustained their communities for generations. This reinforces the curriculum's goal of nurturing both academic skills and cultural identity.</p>

        <h4 style="color: #8aafcb;">EXAMPLES</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
        <p>Language use in the FSM reflects cultural values, social relationships, and community expectations. The following examples show how they can connect with Vernacular Language Arts instruction:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Students learn when to be quiet and listen attentively to elders or teachers, and how to express themselves respectfully in different settings.</li>
            <li>The use of high languages is declining; one chief noted that after assuming a high title, he lost most of his friends because they could no longer speak to him in the appropriate respectful register.</li>
            <li>When explaining new concepts, many people turn to English because certain ideas feel difficult to express in local languages. Students can address this by co-creating new terms or expressions in their own languages.</li>
            <li>Riddles and poetry are more than entertainment; in many FSM cultures they preserve unique ways of thinking and communicating.</li>
            <li>Each major economic activity—farming, fishing, handicraft-making, animal raising, boatbuilding, housebuilding, and sailing—has its own specialized vocabulary. Learning these terms strengthens students' cultural identity and connection to traditional knowledge.</li>
            <li>Many island cultures also use metaphor and indirect speech to show respect, avoid conflict, or restore harmony. Teaching students how these forms function helps them recognize when subtle or indirect language is the most appropriate way to communicate.</li>
            <li>Traditional stories, chants, and legends often encode indigenous knowledge, social norms, genealogies, and community history. When students analyze these art forms, they deepen their knowledge of both the language and culturally grounded ways of interpreting the world.</li>
