        <p>Systems thinking is a discipline for seeing wholes. It is a framework for seeing interrelationships rather than things, for seeing 'patterns of change' rather than 'static snapshots'.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
        <p>Systems thinking, which includes critical thinking, is a way of examining the whole system—how all parts interact and influence one another—to define and solve problems and to support more effective learning and teaching. Language arts can also be understood as a system made up of patterns, relationships, and perspectives. In Vernacular Language Arts, students are expected to think critically as they analyze texts, make connections to themselves and their communities, and apply what they learn in different contexts.</p>
        <p>The FSM Language Policy sets out two clear priorities for the education system: the development of language, and the development of skills and competencies. These include foundational abilities such as basic literacy and numeracy, as well as higher-order thinking skills—"thinking creatively, making decisions, solving problems, seeing things in the mind's eye, knowing how to learn, and reasoning" and essential personal qualities—"individual and group responsibilities, self-esteem, sociability, self-management, and integrity." Recognizing how rapidly the world is changing and how new challenges continue to emerge, the policy affirms one of its guiding principles: "Local languages must expand to allow new concepts and thoughts to be expressed."</p>
        <p>This principle underscores the idea that being grounded in one's own language creates a strong system for thinking and acting, one that can support new ideas and perspectives while helping the language itself flourish. Local languages should be studied as the object of instruction, not merely serve as the medium of instruction. Children's cognitive skills should be developed in their first and local languages, as these languages most fully capture and explain the workings of island systems.</p>

        <h4 style="color: #d6b6c7;">PRACTICE</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
        <p>Language arts practices, such as reading for comprehension, help students analyze content and understand how the elements or parts of a text relate to one another. Relating literary elements—such as themes, characters, and settings—to real-life situations further strengthens critical thinking. Students also apply systems thinking when they plan and design their presentations.</p>
        <p>Systems thinking has been part of traditional island education since time immemorial. It was essential for people to thrive for millennia within the complex and constantly shifting natural systems of the Pacific Islands. For example, traditional navigators taught their students to consider many overlapping patterns when finding their way: the behavior of animals in the sea and birds in the sky, observations of ocean currents and wave interference, the movement of clouds and subtle changes in weather, and the positions and paths of stars and planets in the night sky.</p>
        <p>When students learn about such complex systems and relate them to other aspects of their lives—such as understanding that being a keen observer of nature can also make one a keen observer of people—they gain a deeper sense of how nature and human behavior are connected. By recognizing these complex relationships, they can make decisions that lead to more positive outcomes rather than acting at random. Just as ancient voyagers crossed vast oceans with confidence, students who embrace critical and systems thinking are better equipped to navigate the challenges of life.</p>

        <h4 style="color: #d6b6c7;">EXAMPLES</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
        <p>In Vernacular Language Arts, students strengthen both critical and systems thinking as they engage with texts, stories, and cultural practices, connecting learning to themselves, their communities, and the wider world:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Students can add their own experiences to the story to deepen their understanding and to develop ideas.</li>
            <li>Students can use well-known and familiar characters from local legends and stories in different contexts and settings as a way to apply critical thinking.</li>
            <li>Students can co-develop words and terms in FSM languages for new concepts in science, economics, and technology.</li>
            <li>Students can observe the land, seas, and sky—taking into consideration both indigenous and Western scientific knowledge—to explore complex systems in the natural world.</li>
            <li>Students can observe and document agricultural or fishing cycles in their communities, identifying patterns and relationships that reflect broader ecological systems.</li>
            <li>Students can analyze traditional songs, chants, and dances to understand the social, historical, and environmental systems encoded in cultural practices.</li>
            <li>Developing cognitive skills in local languages first provides a foundation for thinking critically and systematically across all areas of learning.</li>
