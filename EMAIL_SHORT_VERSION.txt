Subject: Digital Library: Cover Page Feature Update

Dear [Customer Name],

Quick update on the automatic cover page feature for your PDFs.

CURRENT SITUATION:
• 50% of your PDFs (750 files) work great with automatic cover pages ✓
• 50% use a newer format that needs adjustment
• All PDFs download normally - cover pages are just an enhancement

YOUR OPTIONS:

1) CONVERT FILES (Free, 2-4 hours work)
   - I provide conversion tools
   - One-time fix for all 750 files
   - Small file size increase (~6%)

2) BUY SOFTWARE (~€150-200, no work needed)
   - Automatic handling forever
   - Works with future uploads too

3) KEEP AS-IS (Free, no work)
   - Half of PDFs won't have cover pages
   - Everything else works normally

HELP ME CHOOSE - Answer 3 quick questions:

1. Do you add new PDFs often? (monthly / sometimes / rarely)

2. How important are cover pages? (very / nice-to-have / not important)

3. Is server storage limited? (yes / no)

QUICK GUIDE:
• Add PDFs often + covers important = Buy software
• Rarely add PDFs + covers important = Convert files
• Covers nice-to-have = Keep current system

Let me know your preference or if you'd like to discuss!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
