# Book Duplication/Template System - TODO

## Overview
Implement a comprehensive book duplication system that allows admins to copy existing books as templates, reducing data entry time from "filling every bit of information again and again" to "1 minute like spreadsheet". This feature is critical for entering books in series, by the same author/illustrator, or with similar metadata.

## Goals
- ✅ Enable one-click book duplication
- ✅ Auto-populate common fields (author, illustrator, publisher, collection, subjects, grades)
- ✅ Clear variable fields that typically change (title, publication year, ISBN, file paths)
- ✅ Reduce data entry errors and inconsistencies
- ✅ Support batch operations for series/collections
- ✅ Achieve target: 1-minute book creation for similar entries

---

## Phase 1: Analysis & Planning

### 1.1 Current Workflow Analysis
- [ ] Document current book creation process in FilamentPHP admin
- [ ] Identify pain points in repetitive data entry
- [ ] Time how long it takes to create a book from scratch
- [ ] List all book fields and their frequency of change

### 1.2 Field Classification
- [ ] **Fields to COPY** (typically stay the same):
  - [ ] Authors (same author in series)
  - [ ] Illustrators (same illustrator in series)
  - [ ] Publisher (usually consistent)
  - [ ] Collection/Series name
  - [ ] Subjects/Purpose tags
  - [ ] Grade levels
  - [ ] Languages
  - [ ] Resource type (usually consistent in series)
  - [ ] Access level (may be consistent)
  - [ ] Description template (can be edited)

- [ ] **Fields to CLEAR** (typically change):
  - [ ] Title (must be unique)
  - [ ] Publication year (varies by edition)
  - [ ] ISBN (unique identifier)
  - [ ] PDF file path (unique file)
  - [ ] Thumbnail/cover image (unique image)
  - [ ] Pages count (may vary)
  - [ ] Physical description (may vary)
  - [ ] View/download counts (must start fresh)

- [ ] **Fields to SMART-HANDLE**:
  - [ ] Subtitle (copy but mark for review)
  - [ ] Edition (increment if series)
  - [ ] Notes (copy but append "Duplicated from [original]")

### 1.3 UX Design
- [ ] Sketch duplication workflow wireframes
- [ ] Design "Duplicate" button placement (list view + edit view)
- [ ] Design duplicate confirmation modal/page
- [ ] Plan visual indicators for duplicated books
- [ ] Design quick-edit form for duplicated books

---

## Phase 2: Backend Implementation

### 2.1 Book Model Enhancement
- [ ] Create `duplicate()` method on Book model
  ```php
  // app/Models/Book.php
  public function duplicate(array $options = []): Book
  ```
- [ ] Handle field copying logic
- [ ] Handle relationship duplication (authors, illustrators, subjects, etc.)
- [ ] Add validation for required fields after duplication
- [ ] Handle file path clearing (prevent accidental file sharing)

### 2.2 Relationship Handling
- [ ] **Authors**: Copy all author relationships
  - [ ] Test with single author
  - [ ] Test with multiple authors
  - [ ] Preserve author order

- [ ] **Illustrators**: Copy all illustrator relationships
  - [ ] Test with single illustrator
  - [ ] Test with multiple illustrators
  - [ ] Preserve illustrator order

- [ ] **Subjects**: Copy all subject tags
  - [ ] Verify many-to-many relationship duplication

- [ ] **Grades**: Copy all grade levels
  - [ ] Verify many-to-many relationship duplication

- [ ] **Languages**: Copy all languages
  - [ ] Verify many-to-many relationship duplication

- [ ] **Collections**: Copy collection assignment
  - [ ] Handle series number logic (auto-increment?)

### 2.3 File Handling
- [ ] Clear PDF file path in duplicate
- [ ] Clear thumbnail path in duplicate
- [ ] Add option to copy files (optional feature)
- [ ] Validate file paths don't point to non-existent files

### 2.4 Data Integrity
- [ ] Reset statistics (views, downloads, ratings)
- [ ] Generate new unique identifiers
- [ ] Set `created_at` to current timestamp
- [ ] Add audit trail: "duplicated_from_book_id" field
- [ ] Prevent circular duplication references

---

## Phase 3: FilamentPHP Admin Integration

### 3.1 List View Actions
- [ ] Add "Duplicate" action to BookResource list view
  ```php
  // app/Filament/Resources/BookResource.php
  Tables\Actions\ReplicateAction::make()
  ```
- [ ] Add icon for duplicate action (copy/duplicate icon)
- [ ] Add confirmation modal before duplication
- [ ] Show success notification with link to duplicated book

### 3.2 Edit View Actions
- [ ] Add "Duplicate This Book" button in header actions
- [ ] Add "Duplicate" option in actions dropdown
- [ ] Redirect to edit page of new duplicate after creation

### 3.3 Bulk Actions
- [ ] Add bulk duplicate action for multiple books
- [ ] Handle batch duplication with progress indicator
- [ ] Add naming convention for bulk duplicates (append "Copy 1", "Copy 2", etc.)

### 3.4 Smart Form Pre-filling
- [ ] Pre-fill duplicate form with copied data
- [ ] Highlight/mark fields that need review
- [ ] Add warning banner: "This is a duplicate. Review all fields before saving."
- [ ] Auto-focus on title field for quick editing

### 3.5 Duplication Options Modal
- [ ] Create modal with duplication options:
  - [ ] ☑ Copy authors
  - [ ] ☑ Copy illustrators
  - [ ] ☑ Copy subjects/grades/languages
  - [ ] ☑ Copy collection
  - [ ] ☐ Copy files (PDF/thumbnail)
  - [ ] ☑ Copy description
- [ ] Save user preferences for duplication defaults
- [ ] Add "Quick Duplicate" (uses defaults) vs "Custom Duplicate" (shows options)

ALTER TABLE books ADD COLUMN duplicated_from_book_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NULL;
ALTER TABLE books ADD FOREIGN KEY (duplicated_from_book_id)
    REFERENCES books(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;

-- Optional: Create templates table
CREATE TABLE book_templates (
    id BIGINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    template_data JSON NOT NULL,
    created_by BIGINT UNSIGNED,

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks
1. **Data Corruption**: Accidentally copying files between books
   - Mitigation: Clear all file paths by default, require re-upload

2. **Performance Issues**: Bulk duplication of hundreds of books
   - Mitigation: Implement job queues for batch operations

3. **User Confusion**: Too many options overwhelming users
   - Mitigation: Smart defaults + "Quick Duplicate" vs "Advanced" options

4. **Relationship Integrity**: Breaking many-to-many relationships
   - Mitigation: Thorough testing, database transaction rollbacks

---

## Notes & Considerations

### Edge Cases to Handle
- Duplicating a book that's already a duplicate (nested duplication)
- Duplicating a book with missing required fields
- Duplicating a book with file paths that no longer exist
- Bulk duplication with partial failures
- Concurrent duplications by multiple admins

### Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- AI-assisted field suggestions based on title
- Smart title pattern detection and increment
- Integration with Excel import for bulk duplication
- Template marketplace/sharing between admins
- Version control for book editions
